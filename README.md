For each task the code has been commented to show the parts that are designated to that task. 
>>HOWEVER, TO ACTUALLY TEST THAT I COMPLETED EACH TASK SUCCESSFULLY, THE USER HAS TO RUN THE FIRST SECTION OF THE CODE THAT HAS ALL THE TASKS' CODE.

>>THE NEXT STEP IS TO SELECT THE .CFG FILE THAT HAS TO BE INVESTIGATED (EVENT 1 OR EVENT 2)

>>NOW WAIT FOR 35MINS (USUALLY THE MAX TIME)...BUT DON'T WORRY I SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE BECUASE I WILL INCLUDE THE WORKSPACE RESULTS OF MY ENTIRE ESTIMATION (FOR BOTH EVENTS!!) =)
EVENT 1 PARAMETERS IN THE WORKSPACE ARE NAMED AS: e.g. Start_time
EVENT 2 PARAMETERS IN THE WORKSPACE ARE NAMED AS: e.g. Start_time_2 ...it has "_2"

>>SO AFTER EITHER RUNNING THE FIRST SECTION ORR OPENINING UP MY WORKSPACE FILE (ADDED TO MY PROJECT SUBMISSION) YOU GO TO THE LAST SECTIONS THAT BEGINS WITH: 
%NOW TIME FOR ACTUAL GRAPHING AND DATA ANALYSIS!!

>>YOU MAY EVALUATE EACH OF MY TASKS FROM THERE. THANKS! AND HAVE FUN!

TASK 4 & 5:
The actual coding for this task starts from: "TASK 4 STARTS HERE", and ends at: "TASK 4 ENDS HERE."
